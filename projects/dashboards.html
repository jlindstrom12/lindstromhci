          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <div class="col-lg-12">
            <p class="tab">For this unit, we were given 3 personas, with Frank and Alanna as our main priorities for designing dashboard around. 
              Designing for a person is easier and has more direction than designing for a vague goal like ‘dashboard for students to listen to a presentation.’
              As such, we had to analyze each persona’s situation, their pain points, their goals, their feelings, etc. using empathy maps and a needs analysis so that we can have a good direction for our final designs.

              Before diving into the dashboards we had to analize our personas and their needs to determine what was important to include on the dashboard. 
            </p>
            <p class = "tab">
              To carry out the needs analysis we referred back to the three empathy maps and took each individual’s overall goals and pain points. Many of the sticky notes overlap with the “what does ____ want to
              do"(The top section of the empathy maps). Some noteable takeaways are Both Frank and Alanna want
              constructive, quality feedback. Furthermore, Both want the presenter to succeed and to not be distracted from the presenter.</p>

            <p class  ="tab">When drawing the rough sketch we wanted the teacher to quickly notice which students needed to respond more so we added color highlights as an indicator.
              Additionally we have a ‘sort by’ feature so the teacher can efficiently find a certain type of student, i.e. inactive one.
            </p>
            <p class = "tab">
              We also allowed the teacher to provide her own feedback on the right by choosing a question via drop down menu and then type in her own response.
              For grading purposes, she also can write notes at the bottom right.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <p class = "tab"> When creating the student dashboard we wanted it to be simple so it wouldn’t take any attention away from the  presentation.
              Listeners are able to see other’s  responses, and then upvote/emote them, as well as sort the responses. The emotes are all positive as we felt this teacher would
              want to enourage positive and constructive feedback as opposed to negative. Students can see questions that the student presenter wants answered via the  right side drop down menu and submit responses.
             </p>
             <p class = "tab">
              Furthermore, At the bottom right, students can  see how their own questions are  being responded to by the class,
              as being the center of attention was part of Frank Tan’s persona and getting satisfaction from  responses will yield better feedback.
