            <p class="tab">For this unit, we were given 3 personas, with Frank and Alanna as our main priorities for designing dashboard around. 
              Designing for a person is easier and has more direction than designing for a vague goal like ‘dashboard for students to listen to a presentation.’
              As such, we had to analyze each persona’s situation, their pain points, their goals, their feelings, etc. using empathy maps and a needs analysis so that we can have a good direction for our final designs.

              Before diving into the dashboards we had to analize our personas and their needs to determine what was important to include on the dashboard. 
            </p>
            <p class = "tab">
              To carry out the needs analysis we referred back to the three empathy maps and took each individual’s overall goals and pain points. Many of the sticky notes overlap with the “what does ____ want to
              do"(The top section of the empathy maps). Some noteable takeaways are Both Frank and Alanna want
              constructive, quality feedback. Furthermore, Both want the presenter to succeed and to not be distracted from the presenter.</p>

            <p class  ="tab">When drawing the rough sketch we wanted the teacher to quickly notice which students needed to respond more so we added color highlights as an indicator.
              Additionally we have a ‘sort by’ feature so the teacher can efficiently find a certain type of student, i.e. inactive one.
            </p>
            <p class = "tab">
              We also allowed the teacher to provide her own feedback on the right by choosing a question via drop down menu and then type in her own response.
              For grading purposes, she also can write notes at the bottom right.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <p class = "tab"> When creating the student dashboard we wanted it to be simple so it wouldn’t take any attention away from the  presentation.
              Listeners are able to see other’s  responses, and then upvote/emote them, as well as sort the responses. The emotes are all positive as we felt this teacher would
              want to enourage positive and constructive feedback as opposed to negative. Students can see questions that the student presenter wants answered via the  right side drop down menu and submit responses.
             </p>
             <p class = "tab">
              Furthermore, At the bottom right, students can  see how their own questions are  being responded to by the class,
              as being the center of attention was part of Frank Tan’s persona and getting satisfaction from  responses will yield better feedback.

            <p class = "tab">The teacher’s view of students 
              in the LoFi prototype does not include color indication of activity. We further added a search bar for the teacher to find a specific students and check their work.
              The teacher can Message a specific student or check their responses via the buttons next to the student name.
            </p>
            <p class = "tab">
              Furthermore, There is now a ‘General’ tab next to the questions so the teacher can write General Feedback without answering a specific question.

          </div>
          <div class = "col-lg-6">
            <p class = "tab">The main changes from the rough sketch is that a student can now easily read the full question on  the right hand side and also scroll through the questions rather than be forced to use a drop down. 
              Allowing the students to know how many questions they must answer via the bubbles and also enabling them to more easily read questions.
            </p>
            <p class = "tab">
              Students also now also have a ‘General’  feedback tab like teachers, if they  click on the button on the upper right
              We eliminated the thumb up emote since it felt too similar to upvote and the heart emotes.
