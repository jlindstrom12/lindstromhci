This dashboard design provides comprehensive insights into manager-related metrics. It includes critical data points, such as whether managers have their shifts or payroll adequately covered. Furthermore, administrators can access information about managers, such as the number of instances they've missed payroll or the number of times their store has experienced incomplete shift coverage. These statistics serve as quantifiable measures of a manager's effectiveness and success in their role.

              Additionally, administrators can review employee statistics for each store, including the average number of weekly absences, the count of underage workers at a particular store, and the average duration of employee lateness to their shifts at that specific store. These insights empower administrators to closely monitor and manage the performance and compliance of individual stores within the organization.

            When designing these dashboard I had different thoughts in mind for Managers and Admins. For Managers I wanted to focus in on their store. 
            This is why I highlighted important elements like the number of employees and info important to their store like shift coverage and payroll completion. I utilized 
            red to go with the inital color scheme to draw attention to the most urgent areas. 
          </p>
          <p class = "tab">
            For the Admin dashboard I took a different approach. I took it a little more broad focusing on the buisness as a whole
            as opposed to individual employees. To do this, I focused on the stores and the managers. Through the Admin dashboards they can see
            important elements like yearly store revenue, Store averages, and the employee statistics for each store.

           <p class = "tab"> Over the course of this project I learned about ruby on rails and using MVC for creating apps.
