            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <p class="tab">Our Persona for this case study is John. John is a retired veteran who has served his country with honor. Now, in his golden years, he faces the struggle of medical emergencies and the challenge of finding the right help in critical situations. 
                </p>
                <p class="tab">John's main struggle is the uncertainty and fear associated with medical visits.
                    He worries about being able to quickly access the appropriate medical care and information when he or his loved ones need it the most. This started with the recent health scare of a close friend. After witnessing the difficulties and challenges his friend faced during a medical emergency, John realized the importance of finding a solution to address his own concerns and ensure his future well-being.

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p class="tab">To gather valuable insights into the preferences, challenges, and expectations of our target users, we conducted a series of interviews at my grandfather's retirement home. The retirement home is home to a diverse group of elderly residents, many of whom have varying degrees of familiarity with digital technology. We aimed to understand their attitudes towards healthcare apps, their daily routines, and the specific pain points they encounter when managing their health.
            </p> 
            
            <p class = "tab">We interviewed 4 individuals, 2 Men and 2 Women asking them the following questions</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Do you use any healthcare apps? If so what apps and how often?</li>
              <li>How comfortable are you with technology on a scale of 1-10</li>
              <li>What methods do you use to track which medications to take.</li>
              <li>What features would you like to see in a healthcare app</li>
              <li>How difficult to you find booking medical appointments to be</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class = "row">
            <h2>User Research Results</h2>
            <p class="tab">For more significant results a wider array of seniors could be interviewed from multiple states and Socio-Economic status(my grandparents retirement home is a very nice and expensive one).
              Furthermore, interviewing more people would have been preferable to increase the validity of our results.

            <h2>User Testing </h2>
            <div class="col-lg-12">
                <p class="tab">After I made my intital designs of the prototypes I performed 3 user tests on classmates of mine with the following user scenarios. This would have been better to do with my target demographic of senior
                  citizens however at the time I was prepared to do User Testing I was already back at school where theere is little access to senior citizens. I plan on doing additional User Testing this Winter when I see my grandparents again.
                </p>    
             
                <ul>
                    <li>As a user you are want to book an appointment with a trusted dentist in your area so that you have security knowing you are going to someone well trusted.</li>
                    <li>As a user you are want to see your past appointments so that you can rebook a doctor you previously went to.</li>
                    <li>As a user you are want to ask a question about what you should do about the lump on your neck so that you can go get the right help.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="tab">After recieving feedback from my users on this I made several changes from the inital designs. Firstly, I made the past appointments page clearer by putting it in tabs at the top of the schedule page.
                    I also added an individual tab in the navigation to get to CareBot. This was hard for users to find as initially it was under a "messages" button on the My Info Page.
                    Finally, users seemed to be able to find how to book appointments and find doctors really easily which I was happy about as it showed me that the process was intutive and clear.

                The biggest surprise was how technology proficient the seniors I interviewed were. My grandfather I had already known

                <p class = "tab">
                    The CareCompanion case study has been an eye-opening journey that deepened my understanding of user-centered design and the profound impact it can have on people's lives. 
                </p>
                <p class = "tab">
                    This project reinforced the importance of putting users at the center of design efforts. John's persona helped us empathize with his struggles and needs, driving the development of features that directly address his concerns. Furthermore, Understanding John's emotional journey made me appreciate the human aspect of designing healthcare solutions. Beyond functionality, the ability to provide comfort and support during challenging times is a powerful motivator in designing healthcare apps.  The process of refining and iterating on the app based on user feedback underscored the iterative nature of user-centered design. Continuous testing and improvement are essential for creating effective and user-friendly solutions.
                </p>
                <p class = "tab">
                    Overall, this case study has deepened my appreciation for the intersection of technology, design, and healthcare, and I look forward to applying these lessons to future projects in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
