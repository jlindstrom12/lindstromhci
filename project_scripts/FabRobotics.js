<h2>Project Summary</h2>
    <div class = "col-lg-12">
        <p class = "tab">The FabRobotics project is a collaboration between the University of Chicago and MIT, aiming to combine 3D printing with mobile robots to improve automation and efficiency. Our team developed a system where mobile robots can interact with 3D printers, making the printing process faster and more adaptable. This setup allows robots to assist in the printing process, customize themselves with 3D printed features, and even handle tasks like assembling parts or delivering printed objects.</p>

        <p class = "tab" >While there are still some challenges to overcome, such as slightly lower print quality with mobile robots, the potential applications of FabRobotics are exciting. Imagine having the ability to instantly create custom figurines or have robots that can adapt to different tasks on demand. Our recent presentation at TEI2024 showcased this innovative approach, and we look forward to further developing and expanding this technology.</p>
        <p class="tab">In this project, I was responsible for designing the GUI, graphic design on the paper, capturing photos and videos for the demo below, and developing the code related to customizing 3D printing commands(GCode). Additionally, I handled the configuration of the APIs for both Octoprint and the Toio Robots to be able to control both in Unison with python.</p>
