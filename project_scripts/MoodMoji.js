<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p class = "tab">Social media is a significant distraction for college students, leading to procrastination and negative emotional cycles. MoodMoji aims to promote awareness and self-reflection on social media use by creating an intervention that encourages healthy alternatives.</p>
<h2>Literature Review</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Procrastination Psychology:</strong> Studies indicate fear of failure and task aversiveness as key reasons for procrastination, linked to depression and anxiety.</li>
    <li><strong>Active vs. Passive Procrastination:</strong> Active procrastinators perform better under pressure, while passive procrastinators suffer from stress and negative self-criticism.</li>
    <li><strong>Goal Setting:</strong> Specific and challenging goals with feedback improve motivation and sustained attention.</li>
    <li><strong>Study Habits:</strong> Good study habits are crucial for academic success, more predictive than cognitive abilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Habit Formation:</strong> Understanding and forming habits can lead to sustainable behavior change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Psychology Theories</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Obfuscation:</strong> Concealing the app's true purpose to increase adoption.</li>
    <li><strong>System 2 Thinking:</strong> Encouraging conscious, effortful thought to break automatic doom-scrolling habits.</li>
    <li><strong>Self-Reflection and Self-Affirmation:</strong> Encouraging users to reflect on their emotions and values to reduce stress and anxiety.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Review of Existing Solutions</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Screen Time:</strong> Tracks usage but lacks personalized emotional feedback and value-based prompts.</li>
    <li><strong>Pomodoro Timers:</strong> Focus on productivity, not emotional well-being.</li>
    <li><strong>Moodnotes and Daylio:</strong> Track activities and moods but lack value integration and automatic engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Headspace:</strong> Offers mindfulness exercises but lacks continuous tracking and integration with daily activities.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p class = "tab">MoodMoji is an app designed to track emotions through emoji prompts and suggest value-aligned activities. It uses obfuscation to present itself as an emoji diary rather than a tool to reduce social media use.</p>
<h2>User Testing</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Low-Fidelity Prototype:</strong> Prompted users during study sessions, but found it too intrusive and stressful.</li>
    <li><strong>Mid-Fidelity Prototype:</strong> Prompted users to specify usage reasons and duration, but was too direct and obvious.</li>
    <li><strong>High-Fidelity Prototype:</strong> Asked users about their feelings after social media use and suggested activities aligned with their values, balancing obfuscation and positive behavior change.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class = "tab">MoodMoji uses persuasive design to increase awareness and self-reflection on social media use, encouraging positive behavior changes through personalized value-aligned activities. Future steps include further personalization, UI enhancements, and long-term impact measurement.</p>
