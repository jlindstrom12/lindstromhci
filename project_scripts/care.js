    <h2>Persona & Problem</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <p class="tab">Our Persona for this case study is John. John is a retired veteran who has served his country with honor. Now, in his golden years, he faces the struggle of medical emergencies and the challenge of finding the right help in critical situations.</p>
      <p class="tab">John's main struggle is the uncertainty and fear associated with medical visits. He worries about being able to quickly access the appropriate medical care and information when he or his loved ones need it the most. This started with the recent health scare of a close friend. After witnessing the difficulties and challenges his friend faced during a medical emergency, John realized the importance of finding a solution to address his own concerns and ensure his future well-being.</p>

        <li>Limited access to medical information and support</li>
        <li>Anxiety with decisions related to making appointments</li>
        <li>Difficulty finding reliable doctors</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-6">

      <ul>
        <li>Concerns about the credibility and effectiveness of available medical emergency services</li>
        <li>Uncertainty about the affordability and accessibility of reliable assistance</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>Primary Goal</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <p class="tab">His ultimate goal was simple yet profound â€“ to attain peace of mind. John envisioned a future where he and his loved ones could effortlessly and rapidly access the necessary medical assistance and information during critical moments. He yearned to feel empowered and confident, rather than powerless, during emergencies.</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>User Research</h2>
    <p class="tab">To gather valuable insights into the preferences, challenges, and expectations of our target users, we conducted a series of interviews at my grandfather's retirement home. The retirement home is home to a diverse group of elderly residents, many of whom have varying degrees of familiarity with digital technology. We aimed to understand their attitudes towards healthcare apps, their daily routines, and the specific pain points they encounter when managing their health.</p>
    <p class="tab">We interviewed 4 individuals, 2 Men and 2 Women asking them the following questions</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you use any healthcare apps? If so what apps and how often?</li>
      <li>How comfortable are you with technology on a scale of 1-10</li>
      <li>What methods do you use to track which medications to take.</li>
      <li>What features would you like to see in a healthcare app</li>
      <li>How difficult do you find booking medical appointments to be</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>User Research Results</h2>
    <p class="tab">For more significant results, a wider array of seniors could be interviewed from multiple states and socio-economic statuses (my grandparents' retirement home is a very nice and expensive one). Furthermore, interviewing more people would have been preferable to increase the validity of our results.</p>
    <p class="tab"> Some notable responses:</p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>Do you use any healthcare apps? If so what apps and how often?</li>
      <li>How comfortable are you with technology on a scale of 1-10</li>
      <li>What methods do you use to track which medications to take.</li>
      <li>What features would you like to see in a healthcare app</li>
      <li>How difficult do you find booking medical appointments to be</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>User Testing</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <p class="tab">After I made my initial designs of the prototypes, I performed 3 user tests on classmates of mine with the following user scenarios. This would have been better to do with my target demographic of senior citizens; however, at the time I was prepared to do User Testing, I was already back at school where there is little access to senior citizens. I plan on doing additional User Testing this Winter when I see my grandparents again.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a user, you want to book an appointment with a trusted dentist in your area so that you have security knowing you are going to someone well trusted.</li>
        <li>As a user, you want to see your past appointments so that you can rebook a doctor you previously went to.</li>
        <li>As a user, you want to ask a question about what you should do about the lump on your neck so that you can go get the right help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="tab">After receiving feedback from my users, I made several changes from the initial designs. Firstly, I made the past appointments page clearer by putting it in tabs at the top of the schedule page. I also added an individual tab in the navigation to get to CareBot. This was hard for users to find as initially it was under a "messages" button on the My Info Page. Finally, users seemed to be able to find how to book appointments and find doctors really easily, which I was happy about as it showed me that the process was intuitive and clear.</p>

    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-12 project_images">
      <img src="../Images/care/final_proto.png" alt="Final Screens for CareCompanion">
      <p class="project_caption">All CareCompanion Screens. (1) Log in screen, (2) Home screen, (3) Doctor's Details, (4) Schedule, (5) CareBot AI Assistant, (6) User Info</p>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>Carebot: Fast Access to Help</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <p class="tab">To address one of John's struggles regarding limited access to medical information and support as well as his difficulty in finding reliable and timely medical assistance, I added an AI assistant to CareCompanion called CareBot. You can ask CareBot questions related to medical support around you, what you should do in emergency situations, booking appointments, and much more.</p>
      <p class="tab">Having this companion easily accessible through a tab in the CareCompanion App, John is able to ask the questions he needs quickly and get responses instantaneously.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <h2>Easy Booking for Appointments</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-8">
      <p class="tab">Addressing some more of John's needs, he feels anxiety with decisions related to making appointments and he has difficulty finding reliable doctors.</p>
      <p class="tab">CareBot touches on this, but also to help with these needs, I decided to make booking appointments and finding his schedule very easy. Right on the home screen, John can see doctors' ratings and specialty. Furthermore, he can sort by the type of doctor to find the type he is looking for. Finally, to help ease some of his anxiety and also to help potentially bed-ridden users of CareCompanion, it is super easy to book both clinical appointments and at-home visits from the home screen.</p>
      <p class="tab">Furthermore, when he is booking appointments, he can see the ratings of doctors in his area as well as reviews from other clients so he can find trusted and reliable doctors.</p>

    <h2>What Surprised Me</h2>
    <div class="col-lg-12">
      <p class="tab">The biggest surprise was how much adding an AI assistant like CareBot to CareCompanion impacted the overall design and user experience. Initially, I was not planning to include an AI assistant, but through user research and the desire to make the app as helpful and user-friendly as possible, it became clear that having an AI assistant would significantly improve the app's value.</p>
      <p class="tab">The inclusion of CareBot required me to rethink how information was accessed within the app and how users interacted with it. The assistant needed to be easily accessible, intuitive to use, and capable of understanding and responding to a wide range of user queries.</p>
      <p class="tab">Integrating AI also meant ensuring that the responses were accurate, helpful, and trustworthy. This added an extra layer of complexity to the project but ultimately made the app much more effective in addressing users' needs.</p>
